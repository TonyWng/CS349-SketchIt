This will start the paint application. Users can create a new canvas by clicking on file > new. 
Users can save and load files by clicking on file > save and file > load. To draw or manipulate objects on the canvas, 
use the widgets on the left side of the screen. The tool bar can be used to draw lines, circles, and rectangles as well as 
select shapes on the canvas to change the stroke and fill colour. The line property box on the bottom left can be used to adjust 
the stroke colour/fill colour as well as the line thickness and style.
